So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

The bacteria in your mouth create a biofilm on your teeth, a thin layer known as plaque.\nThe way oil pulling works is simple, when you swish the oil around your mouth, the bacteria get swept away and dissolve in the liquid oil.\nOil pulling should work with almost any oil, but extra-virgin coconut oil is a popular choice due to its pleasant taste.\nIt also has a favorable fatty acid profile, containing high amounts of lauric acid, which has antimicrobial properties.",

                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.

The main benefit of oil pulling is that it reduces the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth. There are hundreds of different types of bacteria in your mouth. While many are friendly, others are not. The bacteria in your mouth create a biofilm on your teeth, a thin layer known as plaque. The way oil pulling works is simple, when you swish the oil around your mouth, the bacteria get swept away and dissolve in the liquid oil. Oil pulling should work with almost any oil, but extra-virgin coconut oil is a popular choice due to its pleasant taste. It also has a favorable fatty acid profile, containing high amounts of lauric acid, which has antimicrobial properties.",

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing.

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

It's the next level the future of dentistry\n\n\n### Verbal Step-by-Step Explanation\n\nThe man in the video starts by addressing the lack of standards in biological dentistry. He points out that anyone can call themselves a \"bio dentist,\" which leads to inconsistencies in quality and potentially negative patient experiences.\n\nTo counter this issue, he highlights the development of a Bio Dentistry 3.0 certification. This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling.

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

He points out that anyone can call themselves a \"bio dentist,\" which leads to inconsistencies in quality and potentially negative patient experiences.\n\nTo counter this issue, he highlights the development of a Bio Dentistry 3.0 certification. This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

He points out that anyone can call themselves a \"bio dentist,\" which leads to inconsistencies in quality and potentially negative patient experiences.\n\nTo counter this issue, he highlights the development of a Bio Dentistry 3.0 certification. This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",

Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

But that's why we're working on the bio dentistry global standard with the bio dentistry 3.0 certification melting high tech dentistry with functional medicine health optimization preparing our patients before with nutrition the right nutrients and Onside we have IV treatment hyperbaric oxygen anything name it when it comes to overall health optimization. It's the next level the future of dentistry\n\n\n### Verbal Step-by-Step Explanation\n\nThe man in the video starts by addressing the lack of standards in biological dentistry. He points out that anyone can call themselves a \"bio dentist,\" which leads to inconsistencies in quality and potentially negative patient experiences.\n\nTo counter this issue, he highlights the development of a Bio Dentistry 3.0 certification. This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",
