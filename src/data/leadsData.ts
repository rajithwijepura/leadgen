So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency.

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.

The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.

So number one is getting rid of all that toxic containing toothpaste. no fluoride, no SLS, no Triclosan, no carrageenan, no saccharin, no sucralose, go as natural as possible. And instead of fluoride use hydroxyl apatite as an active ingredient. Number two is a ayurvedic strategy that I use on a daily basis is called coconut oil pulling or oil pulling. I use extra virgin coconut oil because it also contains lauric acid, which is antiviral antibacterial. So that coconut oil pulling, you basically just take a teaspoon of coconut in your mouth. You switch it around for 5 to 10, 15 minutes. And then you spit it out into the bin, not the sink. And number three is also an ayurvedic strategy. It's called tongue scraping. I personally use a copper tongue scraper because copper again is antibacterial and you basically just use it and go to the bottom of your tongue. It's a five second thing you should do on a daily basis upon waking to clean off everything that got stuck there through the night like debris or bacteria or food debris, just clean it off. And at the beginning you will have a little bit of a fur going on but if you do that ongoingly consistently, it will all be clean your tongue. So again, the key to all these things is consistency. Do it on a daily basis and you will have teeth hard as stone and beautiful gums.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Introduction:** The video starts with the presenter introducing himself and stating that he will share three top tips for achieving teeth that are \"hard as stone\" and a nice, shiny smile.\n\n2. **Tip #1: Natural Toothpaste:** The first tip focuses on using a natural toothpaste without fluoride, SLS, Triclosan, carrageenan, saccharin, and sucralose.  He recommends using hydroxyl apatite as a natural alternative.\n\n3. **Tip #2: Coconut Oil Pulling:** The second tip is an Ayurvedic practice called oil pulling using extra virgin coconut oil.  He highlights the antibacterial and antiviral properties of lauric acid, present in coconut oil. The process involves swishing a teaspoon of coconut oil in the mouth for 5-15 minutes before spitting it out (into the trash, not the sink).\n\n4. **Tip #3: Copper Tongue Scraping:** The third tip, another Ayurvedic technique, is tongue scraping using a copper scraper.  The presenter explains that copper's antibacterial properties help clean the tongue of debris and bacteria.  He suggests this should be done daily upon waking.\n\n5. **Consistency is Key:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistency in following these three tips for optimal results.  Daily practice is key to achieving the desired outcome of strong, healthy teeth and gums.\n\n",
