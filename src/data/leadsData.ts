                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

It's the next level the future of dentistry\n\n\n### Verbal Step-by-Step Explanation\n\nThe man in the video starts by addressing the lack of standards in biological dentistry. He points out that anyone can call themselves a \"bio dentist,\" which leads to inconsistencies in quality and potentially negative patient experiences.\n\nTo counter this issue, he highlights the development of a Bio Dentistry 3.0 certification. This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",

                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

But that's why we're working on the bio dentistry global standard with the bio dentistry 3.0 certification melting high tech dentistry with functional medicine health optimization preparing our patients before with nutrition the right nutrients and Onside we have IV treatment hyperbaric oxygen anything name it when it comes to overall health optimization. It's the next level the future of dentistry\n\n\n### Verbal Step-by-Step Explanation\n\nThe man in the video starts by addressing the lack of standards in biological dentistry. He points out that anyone can call themselves a \"bio dentist,\" which leads to inconsistencies in quality and potentially negative patient experiences.\n\nTo counter this issue, he highlights the development of a Bio Dentistry 3.0 certification. This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",

                "video_explanation": "# Text Extract\n\nSo let's talk about some of these everyday oral care practices. What are your practices that you recommend to your patients that you yourself use for you and your family that we should be aware of? This is a little bit controversial because it's the opposite of what we get taught in dental school. First of all, a toothpaste should contain no toxins. Ideally should be something you would eat because you put it into your mouth. Why would you eat toxins? I recommend is always having fluoride free toothpaste, maybe on a coconut oil based without triclosan, without sodium lauryl sulphate which is a soap, without sugar or sweet stuff. So basically, go as natural as possible. I only brush my teeth once a day. I have no tooth decay. I have a perfect diet. I have no bleeding gums. So there is a bubble that I'm coming from. So you might need to work this up first. But the goal should be, your teeth are hard as stone because nature has it built that way. Second, do not use chemical mouthwash. The typical chemical mouthwash was marketed very heavily to clean floor. A floor. Why would you put a floor cleaner in your mouth? You also, in my opinion, don't really need flosses. What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

What can we do alternatively to the chemical mouthwash? We use coconut oil pulling. Coconut oil pulling is ayurvedic strategy. It is soothing to your gums. It kills the bad bacteria. It is detoxing to your mouth. Do that daily, consistently and you're golden.\n\n\n# Verbal Step by Step Explanation\n\nThe video starts with two dentists discussing oral care practices.  The first dentist, shown in the top half of the split-screen, asks the second dentist, shown in the bottom half of the split-screen, about their recommended practices. The first dentist highlights that the discussion will touch upon somewhat controversial topics.\n\nThe first point of discussion is toothpaste. The video shows an image of several toothpaste tubes. The dentist argues that toothpaste should ideally contain no toxins, advocating for a toothpaste that is safe enough to eat.  He specifically recommends using fluoride-free toothpaste that is coconut oil-based, and free of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), triclosan, and sugar.  An image of a toothpaste box is shown with the SLS ingredient highlighted.  This is followed by an image of sugar, emphasizing the point to avoid it.\n\nThe dentist then shares his personal oral hygiene routine, which involves brushing his teeth only once a day. He attributes his healthy teeth and gums to this practice, along with a healthy diet. This is presented as a counterpoint to conventional dental advice.  This section ends with the dentist stating that while this approach might be difficult to adopt immediately, the end goal should be to achieve teeth as hard as stone, reflecting their natural state.\n\nNext, the video addresses mouthwash. The video displays images of mouthwash bottles. The dentist emphasizes that one should avoid using chemical mouthwash, citing its past marketing for floor cleaning.  He again argues that the chemicals in commercial mouthwashes are inappropriate for use in the mouth.  An image of a mop cleaning a floor is shown.\n\nThe final topic is flossing. The dentist expresses the belief that flossing isn't truly necessary. As an alternative to chemical mouthwash, he recommends coconut oil pulling, describing it as an Ayurvedic technique that soothes gums, kills bacteria, and detoxifies the mouth. He suggests doing this daily for optimal results.  The video ends with the statement that consistent application of these methods will lead to excellent oral health.",

It's the next level the future of dentistry\n\n\n### Verbal Step-by-Step Explanation\n\nThe man in the video starts by addressing the lack of standards in biological dentistry. He points out that anyone can call themselves a \"bio dentist,\" which leads to inconsistencies in quality and potentially negative patient experiences.\n\nTo counter this issue, he highlights the development of a Bio Dentistry 3.0 certification. This certification aims to create a global standard for the field.\n\nThe speaker explains that the certification combines high-tech dentistry with functional medicine. This approach emphasizes a holistic approach to oral health, involving health optimization through nutrition, IV treatments, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The aim is to prepare patients for dental work and support their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, he concludes by emphasizing that this holistic method represents the next level and future of dentistry.\n",
